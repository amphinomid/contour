# Contour (Chrome Extension, built with [Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js))

Going on Facebook is often a boring, useless, and / or infuriating experience. Even though I don't use Chrome lmao, I made this Chrome extension so you can make chaotic contour art as you use Facebook! (or any other site, idk)

**Directions:** clone the repo, go to chrome://extensions, turn on Developer Mode (top right), click "Load unpacked" and select the repo directory, open the extension by clicking on the icon, click to record, browse page as usual, open the extension, click to stop recording, click again to open art in new tab.

**Note:** this is extremely slow and janky (I'd guess it works about 50% of the time), and I'm pretty sure it only works for a single page (i.e. the data resets if you navigate to another page while recording). It might also only work once per browser session (I haven't really tested this though) lmao. Also, I had to bypass some security settings to get Plotly working... Might try to fix everything in the near future if I have time

**Examples:**
![Black background with white contour lines: vertical, some circular in middle and top right](/not_glitchy.png?raw=true "Black background with white contour lines: vertical, some circular in middle and top right")
![Same as previous, but annotated: vertical = scrolling, circular = liking, clicking navbar, and opening messenger conversations](/not_glitchy_annotated.png?raw=true "Same as previous, but annotated: vertical = scrolling, circular = liking, clicking navbar, and opening messenger conversations")
Not sure what happened with this one:
![Black background with some vertical white contour lines and some sort-of-circular white splotches](/very_glitchy.png?raw=true "Black background with some vertical white contour lines and some sort-of-circular white splotches")

Yes this is the shit I spent my last week of break doing
