**Extremely slow & janky**

Going on Facebook is often a boring and useless experience. So I decided to make this Chrome extension, even though I don't use Chrome. Now you can make chaotic contour art as you go on Facebook!

Note: I'm pretty sure this only works for a single page (i.e. it'll lose the data if you navigate away after clicking "record"). It might also only work once (haven't really tested, though, so unsure)

Yes this is the shit I spent my last week of break doing
